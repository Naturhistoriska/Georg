# georg-service
georg-service is a web service build on top of georg-pelias. It serves as API for Georg. The API provides endpoints for text such as locality search, reverse search and batch upload.

This documentation will help you clone and setup the repository and then start the application.

## Prerequisites
Java 8
Maven 3.5.0
Docker
docker-compose
georg-pelias
## Setup
### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Naturhistoriska/Georg.git
```
### Move into directory
```
cd georg-backend
```
### Build
```
mvn clean package
```
### Run
### Start georg-pelias
Follow instructions on how to setup and run [georg-pelias](https://github.com/Naturhistoriska/georg-pelias) in georg-perlias github repository

### Config pelias path:
```
Open project-initdata.yml
## YAML Template.
---
swarm:
  port:
    offset: 100
  pelias:
    path: http://localhost:4000/v1/

Replace path by pelias path
```
#### Start API
```
java -jar georg-service/target/georgApi-thorntail.jar -Sinitdata
```
## How to use API
Refer to [API Documention](https://georg.nrm.se/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/api/swagger.json) for available endpoints
Currently API provides five endpoints:
* Forward geocoding (/api/search)
* Autocomplete (/api/autocomplete)
* Reverse geocoding (/api/reverse)
* Reverse geocoding with coordinates (/api/coorinates)
* Batch upload (/api/upload)
> Forward geocoding
A free text search to find a place by searching for an address or name.
This search takes query parameters and options:
* text - locality information (This query parameter is required)
* sources - data sources are imported into pelias (Optional).
    * georg-pelias currently supports following data sources (It is possible to expand over the world):
        * Who's on First (wof)
        * OpenAddresses (oa)
        * OpenStreetMap (osm)
        * GBIF (gbif)
        * swe-virtual-herbarium (swe-virtual-herbarium)
* layers - subset of datasource (Optional).
    * georg-pelias supports following layers:
        * venue
        * street
        * locality
        * localadmin
        * postalcode
        * neighbourhood
        * county
        * region
        * macrohood
        * borough
        * country
        * macroregion
        * dependency
        * nhrs-nrm (From GBIF)
        * uppsala-botany (From GBIF)
        * s-fbo (From GBIF)
        * socken (From swe-virtual-herbarium)
* countryCode - Search for specific country (Optional)
    * At present georg-pelias only can georference locations in the nordic countries. By default, the search searches locations in all the nordic countries. By add countryCode swe, the search searches locations only in Swed
* size - define number of suggestions shall be returned from API. The default number is 10
> Autocomplete
With autocomplete, user can type in text from georg-ui and get a real-time result suggestions back without having to type the whole location. Autocomplete takes same query parameters and options as Forward geocoding.

> Reverse geocoding
Find what is located at a certain coordinate location. Reverse geocoding can not georeference on custom dataset based on limition of Pelias.
Reverse geocoding takes query parameters and options:
* lat - latitude
* lng - longitude
> Reverse geocoding with coordinates
Same as Reverse geocoding, this endpoint allows user send in coordinats (latitude and longitude) as a whole text in different format. The supported formats are: dd, dms, and ddm. The latitude and longitude shall be separated by comma or space. ex:
   * '59.350828, 17.938927',
   * '59째21'03.0" N 17째56'20.1" E',
   * '59째21.050' N 17째56.336' E'
> Batch upload
This endpoint consumes MULTIPART_FORM_DATA which allows user to upload a csv file with minimum of two columns: Id, SourceLocality, and get best match result for each locality back as csv or json file. You can download sample csv templet from [github](https://github.com/Naturhistoriska/Georg).
Batch upload takes query parameters:
* type - the type of file returned by API. Currently API supports two type of files returned by API: csv and json
